# Social-Network-Analysis
Assignments of SNA subject.

## Assignment 1
### Email parser
Create a parser to convert from plain dump of emails to .csv format in order to import it from Gephi. Each node must be an email and each edge between nodes is constructed if those two are on the same mailing group on any email.
### Movie actors parser
Create a parser to convert from movies and actors file to .csv format. Each node is a movie and each edge is created if there is one or more actors having worked on both movies (weight is also updated).

## Assignment 2
### Random network
Create a model of a random network (Erd√∂s-Renyi) given the number of nodes an the probability of the edges being created. Optionally the model could also generate several networks with the same parameters. The output must be csv formatted.
### Scale-free network
Create a model of a scale-free network (Barabasi-Albert) given the number of links of an incoming node and the number of steps. Optionally the model could also generate several networks with the same parameters. The output must be csv formatted.

## Assignment 3 (final project)
